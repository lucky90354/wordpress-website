                                Understanding the demand-flow & Planning & Just in time concept of your business is
                                the
                                first step in building an inventory management system. We’ll help you determine when
                                and
                                where you’ll need components & Parts. Then we’ll design a system that integrates
                                with
                                your company’s existing infrastructure to automate each step of the process. Imagine
                                orders predicted and fulfilled automatically – before you run out of stock.

                                demand-flow Systems monitor and replenish your component bins to keep up with
                                production. And our electronic infrastructure and EDI systems reduce paper and
                                eliminate
                                delays by immediately sensing and filling orders via scanner, fax, and other
                                systems.
                                We’ll even plan required stock so that you never worry about running low during
                                high-volume demand time.
